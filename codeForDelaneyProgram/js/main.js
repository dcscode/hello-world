    //my whole life
    //my mom was in the neurodivergent scope and I couldn't access it from within the scope of the spectrum
    //I didn't know my place in the scope
    //I was inside spectrum inside Autism but I couldn't access neurodivergent
    //I didn't know I was in a spectrum
    //I thought neurodivergent === spectrum === autism
    //I iterated up correctly to my mom using the AwesomeInc "Trust the Process" method
    //my mom was in the global scope she could see everything but I couldn't
    //her function helpDelaney didn't run right; it's methods didn't return anything Delaney inside spectrum inside autism could understand
    //she had to update the data her function was calling with better data
    //and now we can communicate
    //im 25 and now i understand my scope
    //i was stuck inside autism i didn't know I was inside a spectrum
    //my mom had work data in mom function
    //but mom function didn't understand how far I was
    //we each had to update our functions so we could talk to each each other
    //I understand outside my scope but I didn't know I was inside somewhere my mom couldn't hear
    //when I was initiated i was already inside my autism scope, i didn't know anyone above me
    //so far, learning this model of the neurodivergence concept has helped me communicate with my mom
    //inside my scope i had figured out to drop mask
    //so when I ran my code everything within my scope worked (people I got to know/met after I dropped my mask)
    //i thought my mom was in neurotypical so my code didn't work, that made sense
    //my mom is above me. im the child in her parent scope
    //and now all her methods (her trying to help me) make sense, i can access them now
    //her methods couldn't reach me at first (until we both knew our place in the scope)
    //now we know which scope we're in and our code will finally work
    //luckily, my mom so happens to have access to the updated relevant data and can funnel it to me
    //not everyone has my mom, not everyone's parent scope has access to that variable
    //now that we're in scope together and know where we go and where each other
    //she can use her personal parent methods
    //I want to make sure no one is ever lost in scope like that
    //I want everyone to be able to access that global data but from where they are, lost in the scope
    //Im 25 and I finally can be understood the way I want where I want
    //I never want anyone to go through being so close but so far
    //by sheer chance and accident I am still alive
    //ive spent so long feeling like I was broken and that since i couldn't fix myself, i should nuke all my code
    //ive been so close for two weeks and my mom had to take that risk to find me in my scope
    //she was afraid i didn't even know I was in the neurodivergent object
    //her methods made my code make sense
    //i want to be able to help people in their scope find where they are and then they can navigate all of them
    //im the me im supposed to be but i couldn't access those properties and my mom didn't know that her methods didn't run
    //i thought i wanted a job that made it easier to be me; punch in punch out people don't hurt me
    //i want to help people understand they're not broken, there's nothing missing
    //they need someone to help them find their scope
